# Netflix Movie Analysis üìäüé•üçø

## Overview
This project is a data analysis of Netflix's movie catalog using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It explores trends, genre distributions, and insights into Netflix's library, leveraging visualizations to enhance understanding of the data.

## Files
- **`Netflix Movie Analysis.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and visualizations.
- **`netflix_data.csv`**: Dataset used for the analysis.
- **`notebook.ipynb`**: Additional notebook for exploring other metrics.
- **`redpopcorn.jpg`**: Aesthetic visual asset for the project.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For aesthetically pleasing statistical plots.

## Key Insights
- **Genre Trends**: Analysis of the most common genres in Netflix's catalog.
- **Yearly Distribution**: Patterns and trends in the release years of Netflix movies.
- **Popular Movies**: Identification of high-rated or trending titles based on dataset metrics.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/menongoutham/Netflix_Movie_Analysis.git

## Project Motivation
Streaming platforms like Netflix play a significant role in modern entertainment. The goal of this project was to analyze Netflix's movie catalog to identify trends, popular genres, and release patterns. This project helped improve my Python and data visualization skills while drawing meaningful insights from real-world data.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
   - Standardized the dataset for consistent analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized genre distribution, release trends, and ratings.
   - Used `pandas` and `seaborn` for insights.
3. **Insights and Conclusions**:
   - Discovered that dramas and comedies dominate Netflix's catalog.
   - Identified release patterns peaking in recent years.
     
## Challenges Faced
- The dataset had missing values, requiring careful data cleaning.
- Creating interactive visualizations for better insights was time-intensive.
- Limited metadata restricted analysis of certain aspects, like user engagement.

## Future Scope
- Include data on Netflix series for a broader analysis.
- Use advanced machine learning models to predict trending genres.
- Explore interactive dashboards using Plotly or Tableau for better visualization.

## Acknowledgments
- The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- Special thanks to the Python , Datacamp (where i initially came across the project) and data visualization communities for their resources.
